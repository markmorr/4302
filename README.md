# 4302
Notes on homework submission:
I interpreted 3(a) to mean a makefile would be acceptable, but I realized later (without enough time to fix it) that might not be what you were looking for (at least it works?). That makefile for part 3(a) resides in the parent folder and is just called makefile.txt. My makefile for 3(b) is in its own folder and may have errors I couldn't solve. Lastly, please run separate_script for 1 (a)-(c) using "separate_script.py --N [num]" where num is the number of folders you want. Thank you!
