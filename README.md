# 4302
Notes on homework submission:
Please run separate_script for problems 1 (a)-(c) using "separate_script.py --N [num]" where num is the number of folders you want. Also, unofortunately you will have to modify the variable base_path to get it to run in your folder system.

I interpreted 3(a) to mean a makefile would be acceptable, but I realized later (without enough time to fix it) that might not be what you were looking for (at least it works?).

Lastly, That makefile for part 3(a) resides in the parent folder and is just called makefile.txt. My makefile for 3(b) is in its own folder and may have errors I couldn't solve. Thank you!
