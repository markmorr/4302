# 4302
Notes on homework submission:
I interpreted 3(a) to mean a makefile would be acceptable, but I realized later (without enough time to fix it) that might not be what you were looking for (at least it works?). My makefile for 3(b) may have errors I couldn't solve. Lastly, please run separate_script for 1 (a)-(c) using "separate_script.py --N [num]" where num is the number of folders you want. Thank you!
